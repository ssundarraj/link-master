# Link Master

A Chrome Extension that lets you see the way links open before you click them. A little icon will pop up near the link when your mouse goes over it. This icon indicates how the link will open (new tab/same tab/new window). A triangle indicates that it will open in a new tab. A circle indicates that it will open in the same tab.
